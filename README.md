This is a JavaScript implementation of the Andres circle algorithm, adapted for arc drawings.

This work has been integrated in the [u8g2 library](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2) for monochrome display purposes.

## Features
### :rocket: [See demo](https://motla.github.io/arc-algorithm/)
- No need for floating point numbers or trigonometric functions in fast approximation mode
- Sets each pixel only once
- Supports start/end angles, arc radius and trace width
